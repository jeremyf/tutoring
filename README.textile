h1. Tutoring

Over the course of this project, I'd like us to make heavy use of git.  I have setup a public repository at "https://github.com/jeremyf/tutoring":https://github.com/jeremyf/tutoring.  From there you'll need to clone the repository and pull the master branch.

It should be noted that in some of these cases we will be muddling through this together.
